## Project Structure

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the files in this project:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the web application. It contains the form where users enter their last name and pet name.
- `index.js`: The main server file using Express.js. It sets up the server, handles form submissions, and generates the band name.
- `style.css`: Contains the CSS styling for the application, making it visually appealing and responsive.
- `package.json`: Lists the project dependencies and scripts.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user enters their last name and pet name into the form.
2. **Form Submission**: When the user submits the form, the data is sent to the server.
3. **Band Name Generation**: The server combines the last name and pet name to create a unique band name.
4. **Result Display**: The generated band name is sent back to the user and displayed on a new page.
